The term  \"Dementia\" refers to any illness which causes losss of brain control. Alzheimer's is the world's leading form of Dementia, and takes up about 60 to 80% of all cases. It affects 33% of the worlds senior citizens, and over five hundred thousand teens and young adults as well. It's a neurodegenerative disease, meaning it happens when enough of the neurons within the brain (Cerebral Cortex) dies out or stops functioning properly, due to many aggregate factors. These factors cause plaque to form in neurons all across your nervous system, but most dangerously in your brain. When a plaque called \"Amyloid Plaque\" builds up in your brain, it makes the neurons around it form tangles called \"Neurofibrillary Tangles\", which ends up killing the cells. This process strikes all across the brain, but the main root for the symptoms of Alzheimer's comes from damage to the cerebral cortexThe cerebral cortex of your brain includes the hippocampus <br><img src=\"http://brainmadesimple.com/uploads/7/8/8/5/7885523/_8300594.png\"></img><br> which controls basic motor functions and long term memories. The cortex is also in control of spacial awareness and navigation. The neurons in the brain work like little circuits to pass on information and commands from the body to the brain and vice versa. When they are damaged, this ability deteriorates along with it. As a result, when Alzheimer's hits, people forget how to do even the most basic of tasks (like breathing or eating), who their loved ones are, and loses their ability to move. The aforementioned aggregate factors include lifestyle, environment and genetic factors. Your diet is a major factor in Alzheimers. <br><img src = \"../Ximg/FoodChart.png\"></img><br> The foods listed in the chart above all could possibly cause Alzheimer's when overconsumed over many years. Another factor in our lives includes lack of brain usage. According to a paper from the NCBI titled \"Brain aging and Alzheimer's, use it or lose it\", it is stated that several observations in postmortem brains indicate that activated neurons are better able to withstand aging and AD, a phenomenon paraphrased by us as 'use it or lose it'. This under the same context, can be understood as a warning that not activating your cortex neurons frequently causes Alzheimer's. Your brain's neurons are activated every time you do a function related to it, so not doing tasks requiring memory usage or deep thinking could be a direct cause of Alzheimer's. All in all, Alzheimers can be considered to be a neurological disease with degenerative tendencies. It has a varying number of causes, which include an unhealthy lifestyle. "

        document.getElementById('myContent').innerHTML = "<h2>What are the Symptoms of Alzheimer's</h2> Alzheimer's disease has many symptoms both physical and mental. Let's start with the physical side. As the neurons in the brain deactivate and die, people lose the ability to move their bodies at will. This is because the hippocampus is not only in contol of memories, but also affects other parts of the brain. The Hypothalamus and Cerebellum are also affected, <br><img src=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/einstein-blog-live/public/uploads/images/46281/alehzimers.jpg\"></img><br> which is the cause of a great deal of motor control loss. The Hypothalamus controls physiologic functions such as temperature regulation, thirst, hunger, sleep, mood, sex drive, and the release of other hormones within the body. When neurons in the hypothalamus die, they cause the body's glands and organs to go haywire, with the most noticeable effects being loss of sleep, and the feeling of either being very cold or very hot all the time. On the other hand, the cerebellum receives information from the sensory systems, the spinal cord, and other parts of the brain and then regulates motor movements. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements such as posture, balance, coordination, and speech, resulting in smooth and balanced muscular activity. It is vital in learning and retaining memory on how to move your body in the ways you want. Loss of neurons in this area will literaly impair people's ability and memories on how to move, leaving them immobile in advanced cases of Alzheimer's. As the many portions of the brain which are affected begin to degenerate, the brain itself physically shrinks to a smaller size, as indicated in the diagram. <br><img src = \"https://masc460.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/alzheimers-disease-diagram.jpeg\"></img><br> Now to move on to the mental side of Alzheimers. The mental side of this disease actually has a lot to do with the physical side, as it is the physical problems which cause the mental ones. As mentioned before, people who suffer from Alzheimers generally forget how to do the simplest of motor tasks, (due to degeneration of the cerebellum), but also loses memories due to degeneration of the cerebral cortex. The memories which are lost include memories accumulated through experiences AND memories on how to move your body, and in severe cases, even how to breathe. As can be seen by the information above, Alzheimer's has both mental and physical symptoms which relate to each other deeply."

        document.getElementById('myContent').innerHTML = "<h2>The Burdens of Alzheimer's</h2> Like the previous section, this can be divided into two categories. The first being emotional and the second being financial. The emotional burdens of Alzheimer's are clear for anybody to see. Alzheimer's is a stretched out diseases, which is in no way quick. It is painful, and patients often suffer for an average of 8 to 10 years before they pass away. This makes it hard on not only the person who has the disease, but also on the family and close friends of the patient, who have to watch their loved one suffer. <br><img src = \"https://images.medicinenet.com/images/appictures/alzheimers-disease-s10-stage-7.jpg\"></img><br> Many patients often ask to be euthenized as the pain of forgetting the life they lived so far is just too much to handle. As Alzheimers strikes almost a third of the world's elderly population, it can be known that Alzheimer's is a substantial cause of sorrow and unhappiness around the globe. Secondly are the financial burdens of Alzheimer's. Alzheimer's is a very costly disease, as it is impossible to take care of a patient without any professional help. The cost of putting a patient in specialized nursing homes or hospitals is 100$ a day, until the patient passes away (Which generally takes up to 10 years). In reality very few senior citizens can afford to stay in  nursing homes for an extended period of time. About 70% of patients have to move out of the facilities after only 3 months of stay. Less than 6% of patients can afford to stay for more than 1 year. \"100 dollars a day\" may depend on the person, depending on insurance and hospital choice, but on average, Korean seniors get $150 of the 250$ fee through insurance. The economic state of seniors is hardly ever good enough to support themselves, so many of them end up receiving support from their children. This financial drain is hard on everybody involved, and as can bee seen by the diagram below <br> <img src=\"../Ximg/Graph.png\"><br> Almost 650,000 Alzheimer's patients live in Korea, with 30,000 of them residing in the Incheon area. These statiscis shows us that over 20 billion korean won gets spent supporting patients. This makes Alzheimer's one of the costliest diseases in the world, and therefore a egregious financial burden for he people involved. "

        document.getElementById('myContent').innerHTML = "<h2>Cures</h2> Although, there aren't any truely clear cut cures for Alzheimer's, treatments do exist. According to the Mayo Clinic, The following are all good treatments for slowing down the progression of Alzheimer's. Firstly, Cholinesterase inhibitors. These drugs work by boosting levels of a cell-to-cell communication by providing a neurotransmitter that is depleted in the brain by Alzheimer's disease. The improvements aren't substantial, as the drug only works as a partial neuron replacement. Cholinesterase inhibitors can improve neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, as well. Secondly is Mementine. Mementine does the same thing as the aforementioned inhibitors, but are stronger and are used for severe cases. Side effects may include constipation, dizziness and headache. <br><img src=\"https://pro.psychcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/cholinesterase-inhibitors.jpg\"></img> <br>Regular Excercise is also recommended for patients as it slows down atrophy from lack of motor control. It also helps reorganize the sleep cycle through use of muscles. However as the disease progresses, it becomes increasingly hard to move and the use of stationary bikes becomes recommended. Avoiding caffeine and drinking plenty of water also helps with re-regulating the sleep cycle. These options may seem to be thin, but experts agree that at this point there is not much more modern medecine can do for Alzheimer's patients. There is research going into the plaque which causes brain degeneration to see if there is a way to stop its buildup all-together, but no major breakthroughs have yet been made. This shows us just how important the prevention of the disease is, as it is nigh impossible to shake off in later life or advanced stages.<br>"

        document.getElementById('myContent').innerHTML = "<h1>PREVENTION</h1> Because curing Alzheimer's is a bleak prospect as of right now, it is of the utmost importance to prevent it from the start. To cite the Mayo Clinic again, The Mediterranean diet — a way of eating that emphasizes fresh produce, healthy oils and foods low in saturated fat — can lower the risk of death from cardiovascular disease and stroke. This diet has also been associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease. Because this diet avoids most of the foods found on the previous charts of dangerous foods, eating a healthy Mediterranean diet can help prevent Alzheimers. Also, using the brain frequently can help prevent it. The more you use a part of your brain, the more neuron gets connected to that portion of the brain. <br><img src=\"https://developingchild.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/neurons-screenshot-300.jpg\" height=\"500px\" width=\"500px\"></img><br>(Diagram of Neuron Connections)<br> This means that using more of the brain reduces the risk of Alzheimer's as it would create more Neuron fodder for later loss, effectivley extending the time it takes for the disease to strike. These facts are supported by the NCDI paper titled \"Brain aging and Alzheimer's, use it or lose it\". This means that the more you use many parts of your brain , the less likely you are to get Alzheimer's when you are older. Because it isn't normal for a brain to use deep thought in menial everyday tasks or (for many people) during their normal day jobs, it is healthy to practice using your brain in your spare time. Playing games like <a href=\"/sudoku.html\">sudoku</a> (which requires memory and logical thinking), or even simple <a href=\"namegame.html\">memory games</a> can help lower chances of Alzheimer's. What's even better is that it doesnt even take a long time to do. Just 30 minutes everyday, and you should be fine. This website offers both options, so click the links above, and improve your neurons!<br> <img src=\"../Ximg/bigbig.png\" height=\"500px\" width=\"1000px\"></img><br>"
